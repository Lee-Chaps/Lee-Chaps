## About
I’m a **Software Developer** who enjoys turning ideas into simple, usable, and well-structured software. I approach development with both **logic and creativity**, thinking carefully about how systems work and how users experience them.

I’m currently an **Intern Software Developer at HealTech**, contributing to frontend features, backend logic, and debugging while learning how real-world systems are built and maintained.

I’ve also completed an **AI & Machine Learning bootcamp**, where I explored data analysis, bias auditing, and ethical AI — strengthening my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
